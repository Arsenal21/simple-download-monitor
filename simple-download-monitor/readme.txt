Easily manage downloadable files and monitor downloads of your digital files from your WordPress site.

== Description ==

I developed the Simple Download Monitor plugin because I needed a nice way to manage my digital downloads and monitor the number of downloads of my files and documents.

This plugin is very useful for managing and tracking your digital file download counts.

You can password protect your downloadable files and documents too (visitors will require a password before downloading the file when you use this option).

There is an option to show an ajax file tree browser so your visitors can browse all your files and download the ones they want.

You can configure downloadable files from your WordPress admin dashboard via an elegant user interface. Then allow your visitors to download the files and this plugin will monitor which files get downloaded how many times.

The plugin will log the IP addresses of the users who download your digital files and documents. It will also log the date and time of each download.

It has a very user-friendly interface for uploading, managing, monitoring and tracking file downloads.
