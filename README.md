Easily manage downloadable files and monitor downloads of your digital files from your WordPress site.

== Description ==

I developed the Simple Download Monitor plugin because I needed a nice way to manage my digital downloads and monitor the number of downloads of my files.

This plugin is very useful for managing and tracking your digital file download counts. 

You can password protect your downloadable files too (visitors will require a password before downloading the file when you use this option).

There is an option to show an ajax file tree browser so your visitors can browse all your files and download the ones they want.

You can configure downloadable files from your WordPress admin dashboard via an elegant user interface. Then allow your visitors to download the files and this plugin will monitor which files get downloaded how many times.

The plugin will log the IP addresses of the users who download your digital files.

It has a very user-friendly interface for uploading, managing, monitoring and tracking file downloads.

Once you have installed the plugin go to "Downloads->Settings" to configure some options

**A) Configure Download Monitor basic settings**

* Admin Options: Remove Tinymce Button - Removes the SDM Downloads button from the WP content editor (default: unchecked).
* Color Options: Download Button Color - Select a default color of the download button (default: green).

**B) Add a new download**

To configure a new download follow these steps:

1. Go to "Downloads->Add New" interface in your WP admin
1. Enter a title for your download
1. Add a description for the download
1. Select the file from your computer and upload it (or use an URL of the file)

You can view all of your existing downloads from the "Downloads->Downloads" interface.

**C) Create a download button**

Create a new post/page and click the "SDM Downlaods" TinyMCE button to insert a shortcode (This button will only show up if you haven't unchecked it in the settings). You can choose to display your download with a nice looking box or just a plain download link/button. 

Example Shortcode Usage:

`[sdm-download id="271" fancy="1"]`  (embed a download button inside a box with other information e.g. Thumbnail, Title and Description)

`[sdm-download id="271" fancy="0"]`  (embed a plain download button/link for a file)

**D) Download logs**

You can check the download stats from the "Downloads->Logs" interface. It shows the number of downloads for each files, IP address of the user who downloaded it, date and time of the download.
